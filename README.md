# Feedreader Testing
**feedreader testing project for the front-end web developer nanodegree at udacity**

## Instructions

You can clone/download a local version to your computer to run it by opening the index.html file in your browser.

After opening the page the tests written will appear and be marked either in green or red. If all tests pass, all are marked green. If there are tests that do not pass, they will be marked as red and include an error message. 

## Code

In this project I used the Jasmine Framework to test the javascript code of a feed reader project. I wrote test-suites to check for the following conditions:

* ensure each feed has a name and url defined, which are not empty
* ensure the menu is hidden by default, changes visibility upon click on hamburger button
* ensure the feed has at least one entry
* ensure content changes when new feed is loaded
